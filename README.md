# Super Mario Bros - Android 

Super Mario Bros is a well known video game that was created by Nintendo in 1985. This game is an android clone of Super Mario Bros with a Winter theme that I designed.
This game began as a personal project to learn android programming and replicate the first Super Mario Bros video game. 
Although, instead of completely replicating the game, this became my redesigned version of Mario's world. The game is currently not completely finished but this is a working demo of the application.
